Research on Shortcut Learning Platforms, Plus Education Insights

- Big productivity gains: one study estimated ~47 hours/year saved just by using Excel shortcuts instead of mouse.
- Most people only know 2–5 shortcuts per program.
- Experience doesn’t mean knowledge – even long-time users often never pick them up.
- Problem = people don’t change habits easily; hard to discover, easy to forget.

Competitors
- ShortcutFoo = gamified drills, “ninja” ranks, timed practice, free basics but paid for full courses.
- KeyCombiner = lets you build custom sets, spaced repetition, detailed stats, big library (VS Code, Excel, Notion, etc.).
- CheatKeys = pop-up cheat sheet when holding Ctrl; shows shortcuts for current app.
- KeyCue = similar cheat-sheet approach, with customizable palettes.
- Keyboard Shortcut Coach = adaptive practice, mostly Mac ecosystem.

Market gaps
- Most tools either dump all shortcuts at once (overwhelming) or don’t help you apply them in real life.
- Lack of personalization → people only need the 10–20% of shortcuts they’ll actually use.
- Weak motivation loops → lots of apps just show flashcards, no streaks, no rewards, no habit building.
- Few beginner-friendly, playful tools → most assume you’re already a “power user.”
- Limited cross-platform coverage (some only on Mac, some only on Windows).

Duolingo insights
- Gamification works: XP, levels, streaks, leaderboards drive people to come back.
- Daily streaks are huge → users with 7-day streaks are 3.6× more likely to stick around.
- Short, daily practice beats long, rare sessions → fits into people’s routine.
- Badges & progress tracking improve course completion by ~30%.
- Showing “time saved” or “shortcuts mastered” gives people proof the effort is worth it.
- Biggest pitfall = info overload + no reinforcement → people drop the app after a week.

Ideas
- Make it playful (Duolingo-style) → streaks, XP, progress bars.
- Customizable courses → users pick shortcuts they want (huge gap KeyCombiner tapped into).
- Practice both recognition & execution → flashcards + “try the keys yourself.”
- Beginner-friendly default course (VS Code), with option for more (Excel, Photoshop).
- Stats dashboard → track accuracy, time saved, shortcuts mastered.
- Could even add a “suggested shortcuts” feature later (based on tasks the user does often).
